# llm-man-page

> **Better man pages, powered by LLM**

`llm-man-page` is a CLI tool that provides more readable and modern command documentation compared to the traditional `man` command.  
It automatically fetches the official man page for any command and uses GPT to rewrite it in a clearer, friendlier way â€” perfect for both beginners and experienced users.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Install

You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourname/llm-man-page.git
cd llm-man-page
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Configure Engine and Model

Set the LLM service, replace `<name-of-service>` with 'openai' or 'ollama':

```sh
llman --engine <name-of-service>

```

Set the model, replace `<name-of-model>` with the model that your service support, like 'gpt-4-turbo' for 'openai'

```sh
llman --model <name-of-model>
```

If you use 'openai' as LLM service, you need to setup your api key by following command, replace `<key>` with your openai api key like 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx':

```sh
llman --key <key>
```

### 3. Usage

Query an LLM-enhanced man page

```sh
llman ls
llman cat
llman grep
```

Result: Directly outputs a more readable man page for the command.
