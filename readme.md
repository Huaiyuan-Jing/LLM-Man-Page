# llm-man-page

> **Better man pages, powered by LLM**

`llm-man-page` is a CLI tool that provides more readable and modern command documentation compared to the traditional `man` command.  
It automatically fetches the official man page for any command and uses GPT to rewrite it in a clearer, friendlier way â€” perfect for both beginners and experienced users.
